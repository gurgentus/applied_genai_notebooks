# GAN Class Activity

As part of this activity we will add the gan model to the helper library we developed as part of Module 4.

You will encorporate appropriate code from Module6-GAN notebook into your helper_lib module. 

---

## 1. Model Module

In `model.py`, define your neural network model:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

def get_model(model_name):
    # TODO: define and return the appropriate model_name - one of: FCNN, CNN, EnhancedCNN, VAE, GAN
    return model
```

---

## 2. Trainer Module

In `trainer.py`, add train_gan function:

```python
import torch

def train_gan(model, data_loader, criterion, optimizer, device='cpu', epochs=10):
    # TODO: run several iterations of the training loop (based on epochs parameter) and return the model
    return model
```

## 3. Image Generator

In `generator.py`, add train_gan function:

```python
import torch

def generate_samples(model, device, num_samples=10):
    # TODO: generate num_samples points in the latent space, run the generator to construct the image, and plot the samples on a grid
    plt.show()
```
