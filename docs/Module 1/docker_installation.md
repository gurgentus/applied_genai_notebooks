Docker is a platform that allows developers to build, share, and run applications in isolated environments called **containers**. Containers make it easy to package applications with all their dependencies, ensuring they run reliably across different systems.

## Why Use Docker?
- **Portability:** Run your application anywhere without compatibility issues.
- **Efficiency:** Lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines.
- **Scalability:** Simplifies deploying and scaling applications.

## Installing Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Follow these steps to install Docker Compose:

### Windows and macOS
Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop. No additional installation is required.

### Linux
1. Download the current stable release of Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | grep -oP '"tag_name": "\K[^"]+')/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```
2. Apply executable permissions to the binary:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```

## Post-Installation Setup

### Verify Docker is Running
Run the following command to check if Docker is installed and running:
```bash
docker --version
```

### Test Docker
Run the following command to test Docker:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
This will download a test image and run it in a container. If successful, youâ€™ll see a "Hello from Docker!" message.

### Test Docker Compose
To test Docker Compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:
```yaml
services:
  hello-world:
    image: hello-world
```
Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
If successful, youâ€™ll see the "Hello from Docker!" message.
